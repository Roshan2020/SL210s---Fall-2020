      <h3> What is Social Media?</h3>

      <p  class = "start">
        For the ones who don't know.
        Social media refers to the means of interactions among people in which they create, share, and/or exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks. The Office of Communications and Marketing manages the main Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Vimeo accounts.

      <h3> Popular Social Media Tools and Platforms:</h3>

      <p>
        
        There are currently 2.8 billion social media users worldwide. This means that over a third of the world’s population is using some form of social media to communicate, making social media marketing an imperative tactic for boosting leads for higher education programs. While social media is a commonplace platform for communication today, have you ever considered how significantly social media changed the way we communicate?
        Our world as we know it has transformed from the start of text messages to the first years of Facebook, to today’s temporary stories.

      The <b>Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA)</b> was the United States Congress's first notable attempt to regulate pornographic material on the Internet.<br>

      <b>In the 1997 landmark case Reno v. ACLU</b>, the United States Supreme Court struck the act's anti-indecency provisions.

      As eventually passed by Congress, Title V affected the Internet (and online communications) in two significant ways. First, it attempted to regulate both indecency (when available to children) and obscenity in cyberspace. Second, <b>Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934</b> (Section 9 of the Communications Decency Act / Section 509 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996)[3] has been interpreted to say that operators of Internet services are not publishers (and thus not legally liable for the words of third parties who use their services).

      The <b>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</b> gives parents control over what information websites can collect from their kids. The COPPA Rule puts additional protections in place and streamlines other procedures that companies covered by the rule need to follow.

      COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.

      The <b>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</b> is the toughest privacy and security law in the world. Though it was drafted and passed by the European Union (EU), it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU. The regulation was put into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR will levy harsh fines against those who violate its privacy and security standards, with penalties reaching into the tens of millions of euros.<br>

      With the GDPR, Europe is signaling its firm stance on data privacy and security at a time when more people are entrusting their personal data with cloud services and breaches are a daily occurrence. The regulation itself is large, far-reaching, and fairly light on specifics, making GDPR compliance a daunting prospect, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

      The <b>Telecommunications Act of 1996</b> is the first major overhaul of telecommunications law in almost 62 years. The goal of this new law is to let anyone enter any communications business -- to let any communications business compete in any market against any other. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 has the potential to change the way we work, live and learn. It will affect telephone service -- local and long distance, cable programming and other video services, broadcast services and services provided to schools. The Federal Communications Commission has a tremendous role to play in creating fair rules for this new era of competition.
